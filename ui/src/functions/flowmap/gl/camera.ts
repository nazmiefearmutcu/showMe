/**
 * View transform — the pan/zoom camera (§8.3, M2 T6).
 *
 * This module is the reason FlowMap does not have the v1 1-fps bug. v1
 * re-rasterized all resident history on the CPU every frame it panned; here the
 * camera is nothing but six scalars, and every pan/zoom is O(1) — it mutates
 * those scalars and produces the four `HeatmapView` uniforms. A column, once
 * uploaded to the tile texture (see TileRing), is NEVER touched again by a
 * pan/zoom: the fragment shader re-reads the same texels through a different
 * linear map. Interaction cost is independent of history depth.
 *
 * State (canonical center+span form, so cursor-anchored zoom is symmetric):
 *   - time:  `colCenter` (absolute column at the viewport's horizontal center,
 *            fractional) + `colSpan` (columns across the viewport = time zoom).
 *   - price: `rowCenter` (absolute row at the viewport's vertical center,
 *            fractional) + `rowSpan` (rows across the viewport = price zoom).
 *   - `followTime`: auto-track the live right edge.
 *   - `followPrice`: how the price axis auto-scales — see {@link PriceFollow}.
 *
 * **Per-axis follow.** The two axes used to share ONE `follow` boolean, so any
 * gesture froze both and price was never tracked again. They are independent
 * now: scrolling back through time keeps the price axis auto-scaling, and
 * zooming price keeps the right edge pinned to now. The pure `applyKill` below
 * is the single place that encodes which gesture releases which axis.
 *
 * **Overscroll.** `rowCenter` is clamped to a SPAN-RELATIVE band that extends a
 * full viewport past each edge of the price grid ({@link rowCenterBounds}), so
 * the user can push the grid entirely off screen in either direction — the
 * "look infinitely far up/down" gesture. That is visually safe with no shader
 * change: the fragment shader already paints the LUT floor (`background()`) for
 * any row outside `[0, rows)`. `rowSpan` tops out at the USER zoom-out cap
 * `maxRowSpanZoom` (≈ MAX_ROW_SPAN), deliberately far past the grid height — the
 * same decoupling the time axis has — so zooming price out to "the whole market
 * in one view" hits no artificial wall. The one trade-off, identical to the time
 * axis's deep zoom-out: past ~16 rows-per-pixel `Renderer.currentLevel()`
 * saturates at SUM-mip level 2, which renders from the mips and suppresses
 * scroll-back backfill (see net/history.ts).
 *
 * All operations are PURE — they take a state (+ limits) and return a new state,
 * so the math is unit-testable with no GL context (see camera.test.ts). The
 * `Camera` class at the bottom is a thin imperative wrapper the renderer holds.
 *
 * Uniform mapping (matches the heatmap shader `col = colOffset + colScale*uv.x`,
 * `row = rowOffset + rowScale*uv.y`, with uv.y = 0 at the BOTTOM of the grid):
 *   colOffset = colCenter - colSpan/2   (left edge)
 *   colScale  = colSpan
 *   rowOffset = rowCenter - rowSpan/2   (bottom edge)
 *   rowScale  = rowSpan
