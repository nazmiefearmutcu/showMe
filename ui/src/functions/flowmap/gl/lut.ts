/**
 * Heatmap colormaps (§8.3 / §9).
 *
 * Four ramps live side by side in one 256×4 RGBA8 atlas texture so the fragment
 * shader can select a ramp with a single uniform and a single texture bind:
 *   - row 0 (RAMP_INFERNO): density ramp — near-black → indigo → violet →
 *     magenta → RED → orange → saturated gold as density rises.
 *   - row 1 (RAMP_SYNTH): a distinct single-hue amber ramp for SYNTHETIC equity
 *     depth, so fabricated density reads as visually different from real L2.
 *   - row 2 (RAMP_CLASSIC): the legacy thermal ramp (blue → cyan → yellow →
 *     saturated yellow-gold), kept as a user-selectable option.
 *   - row 3 (RAMP_FLOW): the DEFAULT — a restrained "deep water" ramp (near-black
 *     slate → dark navy → deep teal → sage → sand → bright gold). See FLOW_STOPS.
 *
 * **Why the default changed.** The classic thermal ramp crosses half its
 * luminance range by LUT index 96 and spent its top third in bright
 * cyan/yellow/white (its old endpoint was literally white): a wall and a
 * mid-sized resting order land in visually adjacent colours and the field
 * reads as "blue with bright stripes". The inferno family spreads the same
 * range across FOUR distinct hue families (indigo / magenta / red /
 * orange-gold) and caps in saturated gold rather than white, so relative
 * density is legible by hue, not just by brightness.
 *
 * **Why the tops are gold, not white.** The price line overlay is white, so a
 * white ramp top would make a max-density wall indistinguishable from the
 * price line. Both real-depth ramps therefore end in saturated gold/yellow —
 * still their brightest stops (luma stays monotone), but blue-starved, so the
 * two never merge.
 *
 * **Why not yellow → red.** Every ramp here must be monotone in
 * luminance — the whole point is that hotter reads as brighter, and lut.test.ts
 * locks it. Pure red has a LOWER luma than yellow, so putting red above yellow
 * would make the ramp dip and a big order would read *darker* than a medium one.
 * Inferno reaches a strong red at ~70% of full luminance, on the way up, which
 * satisfies both constraints at once.
 *
 * **Honesty (§7) outranks the user's colormap choice.** {@link rampForMode}
 * evaluates the synthetic-depth tier FIRST and unconditionally, so no setting
 * can dress fabricated equity depth in a real-depth ramp.
 *
 * `buildRamp` / `buildLUTAtlas` are pure (return Uint8Array) so ramp shape,
 * monotonicity and selection are all unit-testable without a GL context.
