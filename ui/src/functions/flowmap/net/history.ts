/**
 * Deep scroll-back history backfill (§8.3 residency, M2 T8).
 *
 * The full-res tile ring holds a bounded recent window (the residency budget,
 * see gl/tileRing). When the user pans LEFT past the oldest resident column and
 * older data still exists, the {@link HistoryLoader} issues a `HistoryRequest`
 * for the missing range, splices the returned `depth_cols` back into the ring at
 * their TRUE absolute col_seq (the ring self-slides its window backward and
 * evicts the live edge — the LRU end), and regenerates the affected SUM-mips.
 *
 * Design notes upheld here:
 *
 * - **col_seq ↔ before_t mapping.** Each column carries its own `t0_ns`, so the
 *   loader tracks `(col_seq → t0_ns)` for resident columns as they arrive (live
 *   or backfilled). To fetch the page immediately older than the oldest resident
 *   column it requests `before_t = t0_ns(oldestResident)` — the server's
 *   `history(before_t, n)` is EXCLUSIVE, returning the n most-recent columns with
 *   `t0 < before_t`, i.e. exactly the ones just older than what we hold. When the
 *   exact t0 is unavailable it falls back to `oldestT0 − k·dt_ns` (the spec's
 *   fallback). No dependence on col_seq==interval-index (the sim skips seqs on
 *   capped gaps), so the mapping is robust.
 *
 * - **Coalescing / debounce.** At most ONE request is in flight; `ensureVisible`
 *   is a cheap O(1) guard (compares the visible left edge to the resident oldest)
 *   so it can run every frame without history-proportional work — the §10 perf
 *   gate requires the per-frame path stay O(visible), not O(history).
 *
 * - **Start of history.** The server reports `oldest_available_t_ns`; when a
 *   response is empty or we have reached that bound (or col_seq 0), the loader
 *   latches `startOfHistory` and stops spinning — scroll-back is exhausted, not a
 *   busy-loop.
 *
 * - **Deep zoom-out.** When the price mip level-2 is engaged (or the time span
 *   exceeds the full-res budget) the view renders from the SUM-mips and native
 *   full-res residency is neither achievable nor needed, so backfill is
 *   suppressed — we never try to re-populate the whole extent full-res.
 *
 * The loader is transport-agnostic: it depends only on an injected
 * `requestHistory` (the store's) and a `spliceColumn` sink (the renderer's), so
 * the range-computation + debounce logic is unit-testable with a fake.
